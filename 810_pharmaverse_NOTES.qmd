# My Notes

## To Do:
- latest standards, get snippet of what each looks like

## GOAL:
Understand flow of data and structures, end-to-end:
- at json file/schema level
- at R implementation level
- able to connect the two at different stages  

## intro notes

(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "<tab>") 'evil-toggle-fold)

S-<TAB> cycles
C-ENTER new line, at same level

## Tools

For Package:  Use these:

- styler::style_pkg() \
- devtools::lint()   # package   \
- devtools::test_coverage()   # entire package 
- devtools::spell_check(use_wordlist = TRUE) # package 
- spelling::update_wordlist(pkg=".") # runs spell AND asks to update WORDLIST  

For File:  Use these:

- active_fie =  rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path 
- devtools::test_active_file() 
- devtools::test_coverage_active_file()
- styler::style_file(path = )   # dir, file
- lintr::lint(filename="")
- spelling::update_wordlist(pkg=".") # runs spell and asks to update WORDLIST
- urlchecker::url_check()

(see lintr package - many options to control nolint)
https://lintr.r-lib.org/articles/lintr.html
lintr::lint()

```
# nolint start
...
# nolint end
 ```

### What is CDISC?

The "I" is for interchange, ie to move data between computers and applications. In particular, CDISC is an attempt to standardize structure of data that flow from patient through data analysis so things like dates, units, dataset fields are consistent. At the government/regulary agency end, the standardization of data simplifies comparisons.

CDISC is intended to be an improvement over [prior methods](https://www.cdisc.org/kb/articles/short-history-cdisc-and-sas-transport-files) to exchange data.

From an R developer's point-of-view, this roughly boils down to data tables and format.  CDISC is both an abstraction and a guide to choosing the right variables. 
Just like an engineer who grows special crystals might benefit from learning a bit about group theory and various symetries, so too an R developer might pick up insights from CDISC abstractions.


Depending on abstraction:
PLAN -> COLLECT -> ORGANIZE -> ANALYSIS -> REPORTS
OR, 
CDISC -> CDASH -> SDTM -> ADaM ->data analyst

[CDISC wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_Data_Interchange_Standards_Consortium>)
 Good, not perfect, one page summary.

### Where to Start with CDISC?
Basic introduction:
- **CDISC 9 short videos (JAN 2025)** : <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muzo9veBOFw&list=PL4vFrmnpUDeRziW2ozobayozgukgAmL1S>

- [**CDISC data exchange definitions**:] (https://www.cdisc.org/standards/data-exchange)
- **CDISC Genius (AI) :** https://chatgpt.com/g/g-677223310d8081918ca4bdda574a5384-cdisc-genius 
- **CDISC Primer** :  https://www.cdisc.org/primer
- **cdisc api library** (info)  https://www.cdisc.org/cdisc-library

### What are the CDISC specs?

 Example:  In ADaM specify columns, or  the type (string, number etc)  is determined by metacore (metadata) and this in turn is based on ...
- Goal?  At R level, structure of ADaM, SDTM tables (deliverables) 
- [CDISC videos](https://www.youtube.com/@CDISCInc/playlists)
- [CDISC Glossary](https://datascience.cancer.gov/resources/cancer-vocabulary/cdisc-terminology)


### What exactly are these CDISC specs?
ODM   - At simplest level, ODM is overall guide to formatting data/metadata; what ADaM and SDTM datasets should look like and how to pass as JSON files.

### What is Define-XML
**define-xml** describes how to (encapsulate??) metadata needed to create  tabular dataset structure  into a json `container`.

### What is dataset-json standard ?
"dataset exchange format" in JSON file for tabular datasets
Read https://swhume.github.io/why-json-for-datasets

- XML,  structured document (DOM, body, src, images,...)
- JSON, structured data

### R implimenation

**datasetjson** 
- R package convert cdisc data between json and r data.frame + special attributes (good example code)  
(json is usually only the transfer, not stored at either end).   

- hard code special attribute(?) , ie not reading and incorporating info from json spec
https://github.com/atorus-research/datasetjson.  

- uses package **jasonvalidate::** to confirm data and a schema match.

## Empty Placeholder
## FAQ

**Tests**
In tests, how to check correct error/warning is issued?**

-  Please use expect_snapshot() to ensure that the correct error
message is issued.  By the way, unit test for errors and warnings
should never accept any error or warning but always check that the
expected one is issued (by using expect_snapshot() or the class
argument of expect_error()/expect_warning() ).

**Is my version of admiraldev, pharamverse, out-of-date?**
- Check:  Namespace file & packageVersion("admiraldev")
- install latest from github by using devtools::install_github("pharmaverse/admiraldev"

When we depend on a dev version of a package, we should also indicated this in our DESCRIPTION file FYI

Imports:
    admiraldev (>= 1.1.0.9006),

It used to be the case, that Remotes: would re-install all pkgs listed in Remotes upon installation of the pkg, but that is no longer the case after pak replaced remotes for GH intallations.


*Skills to focus on:*
https://pharmaverse.slack.com/archives/D07DL8CP00G/p1728234941977779
 `templates, documentation & navigation, pkgdown & organization, R environments`


*Data:*
https://pharmaverse.slack.com/archives/D07DL8CP00G/p1722857716071859

*What is "starting date" ?*
    When is example data contrived, from CDISC, a subset etc. the data usually starts at Informed Consent - RFISDTC

*When to use metacore/metatools ?   Or,   admiral?   Seems to be overlap.*

    Yes there are lots of overlap between the packages.  For example, there are functions in metatools to bring copies of variables from SDTM or you could just use dplyr or base R to bring them over.  We built them independent so you didn't have to commit to them if you wanted to use one or the other.  I use both in my ADaM programming and work well together.  I think the example site has best example.

*How many "ADaM(s)" are there?*

    3 types of Adam (ADSL, BDS, occ...)   Is there ONE ADSL or many kinds;  was very confused about this.

    There is only one ADSL in each study, but each study's ADSL will
    look different depending on what is needed for Subject-level data
    as defined in the Study SAP (Statistical Analysis Plan), for
    example baseline tables and endpoints.  There is a forth ADaM
    called ADaM Other - which captures some exotic ADaM structures.
   

**Templates:**
(not FAQ, a direction) We are trying to compare things from the templates in CI Workflow; use of diffdf

Why do we use both library(pharmaversesdtm::ae) and ae=pharamaversesdtm::ae

We are just trying to be explicit on where the data is coming from as
we are assuming folks are not super familiar with R yet if they are
using our template programs.  Yes we could drop the library() call,
but the comment on the datasets origin is important to also point out
to new users.


*What topics does bi-weekly Admiral meetings cover?*

A lot of what we make is based on the Study Design and questions being
asked in the study to prove the safety and efficacy of the drug
through something called the SAP (Statistical Analysis Plan).  So
which ADaMs, TLFs you pick is really dependent on the SAP.  There is
something called the Protocol that is a higher-level version of the
SAP which influences the eCRF (electronic Case Report Form) and
determines what data is collected.However, you will always have an
ADSL dataset!!

We have bi-weekly meetings on Wednesdays at 10 AM US EST.  They are
not mandatory to be in the group but highly encouraged.  You get to
meet various people and participate in discussions.  However, we
understand that can be tough with full-time job needs.  Occasionally
we split out into Working Groups to tackle various topics.

**History of package datasets**
https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/D07DL8CP00G

I'm not worried about creating the data in admiral.  I believe this is
the way forward that you have been working on.We have been doing it
for 3 years now just not using the recommended data/data-raw
convention.The pharmaverseadam package was created to allow folks to
load ADaM data for other projects rather than having to load admiral.
We actually used to have all those ADaMs in admiral but it bloated the
package and decided to remove them.  So pharamverseadam came later and
it is a little confusing as our templates make those ADaMs and so adsl
is identical between the two packages.The templates should create the
datasets (adsl and adlb).  admiral_adlb should require some subsetting
with the proposed Subjects.  If the data is not an exact match, then
it would be nice to understand what is not matching.  The diffdf
package is very nice for this.If it doesn't match, then lets figure
out why and it might just be a minor updates to the templates that
have been done over the last few years.  AGain I'm not particular
worried as the package hasn't changed so drastically that the Hy's
Vignette would become unusable. (edited)

https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/discussions/2169#discussioncomment-10376594

Once you do a few more successfully merged PRs I will propose to core
team that you be included! Be great to have you involved.

*Reviewers: PR*
(Ben) So I see everything that happens in admiral: issues, conversations,
PRs, etc as I have my settings that way.
Yes always assign a reviewer.
You can ping people you have interacted with and ask for review or use
@pharmaverse/admiral teams to ask for additional reviewers.
If crickets, ping on slack as well; Stefan is the best for thorough
code review.  Edoardo and I are okay for code, but we are very user
focused and pay close attention to documentation of usability of the
function.
there are a few others out there but you haven't interacted
with them much yet

## Working with JSON
See https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step 

JSON data, but with more info not really sure of context, can even validate:  use JSON Schema!

```
{
  "productId": 1,
  "productName": "A green door",
  "price": 12.50,
  "tags": [ "home", "green" ]
}
```


Schema has few special `schema keywords`
With right tool, can validate the JSON data is indeed a valid JSON and follows JSON schema.
```
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "https://example.com/product.schema.json",
  "title": "Product",
  "description": "A product in the catalog",
  "type": "object",
  "properties" : {
	"productId": {
	  "description": "the productID is unique identifier",
	  "type": "integer"},
	"productName": {...},
	"price": {...},
	

   "required": [ "productId", "productName", "price" ]    # these are required
}
```
